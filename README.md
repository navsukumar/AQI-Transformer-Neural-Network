# AQI-Transformer-Neural-Network

This repo contains the notebook of our code used to run an experiment on the best model to forecast Air Quality as well as the code used to build the Temporal Fusion Transformer Model. The Repo also contains a report fully detailing the EDA, experimental design, process of building the neural network model, and analysis of the model.
